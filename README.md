### Things I learned

- DOM Manipulation, specifically using different Event Listeners, named functions and making a grid slider
- Revisiting HTML structure/CSS styling to make a simple UI, get it responsive and add a color picker
- Creating/altering HTML elements with JavaScript (resizeable grid using for loop)
- Learning console.dir() to search for useful properties
- Reviewed how to import assets such as fonts/icons

### Thoughts on project

- Starting this project was daunting at first, but after creating the grid with a loop, I broke it down into smaller steps and it slowly came together. I particularly enjoyed looking into the different events that can be added to elements and how they work differently when used, generating the random button and using template literals with it, and creating a fully functioning slider.
